# marklogic-javascript-query-snippets
Useful functions/snippets of code intended to help when using the query console on a MarkLogic server

Designed to be a useful reference to speed up work rather than directly pulled in as a package or anything like that.

This will probably build up quite slowly as I have (or anyone else who wants to contribute has) a need for more things. So far it's got examples for a few things where I've repeatedly thought "this should be easy" and then had to spend longer than I'd like looking things up.

## Want to contribute?

Sure! This is a collection of material rather than anything with a specific roadmap or plan, so just go ahead and create a PR. Please make sure that things are well named and documented.
