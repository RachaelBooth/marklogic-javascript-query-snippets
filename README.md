# marklogic-javascript-query-snippets
Useful functions/snippets of code intended to help when using the query console on a MarkLogic server

Designed to be a useful reference (/source for copying some functions) rather than directly pulled in as a package or anything like that.

This will probably build up quite slowly as I have a need for more things, but I've got a few things to seed it with initially.

## Want to contribute?

Sure! This is a collection of material rather than anything with a specific roadmap or plan, so just go ahead and create a PR. Please make sure that things are well named and documented.
